/**
 * This class provides a framework for action threads. Requirements for this
 * framework are: - A thread has a name - Start manually by the 'execute' method
 * - The implementation of an action thread will be terminated by a call to the
 * 'kill' method. The 'kill' method must wait for the thread to finish before
 * returning. - onExecuting method is called once when begining the thread
 * implementation - onKilling method is called once before the thread finishs
 * its execution - onException method is called when the implementation causes
 * an exception, after an exception is raised, the thread implementation is
 * reset - sleeptime returns the period of time in miliseconds to be sleeped
 * between two actions (return NO_SLEEP indicate no needing to sleep) - action
 * method is step by step action of the thread. An action may not be block, it
 * should return after a period of time NOTE: only the thread which created a
 * new action thread may kill it or an action thread is also able to kill
 * itself.
